# Stopwatch project

This project consists of HTML, CSS and JS files for a stopwatch which has the
functionalities of 'Start', 'Stop' and 'Reset'. 

We have used the setInterval() function of JS to update the timer of stopwatch.
We are keeping the track of elapsed time in another variable, which will help us
to restart the timer from the last time.
The reset funtionality clears the interal ID and resets the time to 00.
